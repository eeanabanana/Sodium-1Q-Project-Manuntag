                <p id= "topic5">
                    I am a scholar at a science high school focused on raising awareness about my topic. My family's experiences are tied to this issue; my grandmother had four children, but only my mother and her youngest brother thrived. However, my aunt and another uncle lacked the opportunity to attend prestigious schools. With my grandmother's support, my mother enrolled in an excellent program, and my uncle later moved to the U.S. thanks to her help. My aunt became a nurse independently, and my other uncle remained unemployed. Our family faced significant financial challenges and had limited resources to acquire higher education. My class schedule is shown above. During ComSci 3, I coded this website for almost 2 weeks.
