            <p id="text1">Quality education is important but requires investment, with costs in the Philippines ranging from Php 25,000 to over Php 250,000 every year(Allianz Philippine National Bank, n.d). For families with multiple children, these expenses can be overwhelming, leading to unequal educational opportunities. <br></br>Many children are forced to attend lower-quality schools or drop out to support their families. This cycle deepens poverty and limits dreams. Some large families, struggle as tight budgets must cover tuition, uniforms, and books, often leading to early dropouts (Orbeta, 2006).<br></br>Fewer years in school result in reduced job opportunities and lower income, perpetuating the cycle of poverty.</p>

            <p id="text2">We can work together to help every child get a fair education. We should expand scholarships, provide cash support, and improve school resources so children don’t have to drop out due to costs like tuition, uniforms, and transportation. Let’s strengthen public schools and offer free or low-cost materials while promoting local programs for book lending, tutoring, and volunteering. We should support family planning and offer flexible learning options, such as evening classes or alternative programs for students who need to work or help at home. Small steps can lead to real change. </p>
